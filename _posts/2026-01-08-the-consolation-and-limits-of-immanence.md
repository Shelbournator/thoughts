description: "Two poems by William Carlos Williams raise the question of whether meaning grounded in attention and immediacy can endure beyond youth, intimacy, and place."
---

Today, ChatGPT suggested another poem by William Carlos Williams, and I found that I was more than happy to go along with it.

[Yesterday’s poem]({% post_url 2026-01-06-attention-simplicity-and-meaning %}), _The Red Wheelbarrow_, has stayed with me in a way few poems do. Its concision, clarity, and confidence in meaning felt deeply aligned with how I prefer to think. It was something I found myself chewing over—ruminating, as Nietzsche might say—long after reading it.

I’ve always had a soft spot for some of the early American literary figures. In many ways, they seem to have taken the best parts of the British literary tradition and dropped some of the worst. There is a groundedness, a democratic instinct, a resistance to unnecessary ornamentation. But crucially, this simplicity is not born of naivety or lack of sophistication. These were deeply educated, serious thinkers making deliberate aesthetic and philosophical choices.

Looking more closely at Williams’ relationship with T. S. Eliot makes this clearer. Although they were close personally, Williams’ poetry reads almost like a rebuttal to Eliot’s Europe-centric sensibility—a sensibility Eliot himself ultimately embodied by moving to Britain. Williams’ stance reminds me of another figure I deeply admire: Ralph Waldo Emerson, particularly in Self-Reliance and The Harvard Divinity Address. In all of these writers, I see an American confidence: self-reliance, self-determination, and a belief that meaning should not require mediation by inherited authority.

There’s something Orwellian in this too—the idea that good writing, and perhaps good thinking, should be clear, direct, and intelligible without being coarse. Williams’ simplicity feels intentional, disciplined, and ethical.

Today’s poem was [This Is Just to Say](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56159/this-is-just-to-say). Like The Red Wheelbarrow, the title itself does a lot of work with very little. “This is just to say” sounds hesitant, almost apologetic. It feels intimate. It’s the kind of phrase you use with someone you know well, perhaps someone you live with.

The poem opens with a small confession: “I have eaten / the plums / that were in / the icebox.” The tone is mischievous, almost childlike. It immediately brought to mind the experience of being young—of acting on impulse, of being drawn into the world without reflection. The speaker clearly enjoyed the plums, perhaps more than the person who was saving them for breakfast ever would have.

There’s a strong sense of shared space here. The speaker had access to the icebox. They knew the routine of the person they’re addressing. This is a confession, but a domestic one, bounded by familiarity and affection. “Forgive me / they were delicious / so sweet / and so cold.” The apology is sincere, but it’s also playful. Pleasure quietly justifies itself.

As with The Red Wheelbarrow, the meaning feels effortless. Williams’ famous maxim—“no ideas but in things”—is fully operative here. There is no abstraction, no explanation, no attempt to extract a lesson. The sweetness of the plums is the meaning. The relationship is the context. The apology is the ethics. Each act needs no further justification.

What struck me, though, is how closely this way of seeing aligns with childhood consciousness. Meaning feels immediate, embedded, unquestioned. Things matter because they are experienced. They justify themselves. This is deeply attractive, especially after the metaphysical anxiety of [Yeats]({% post_url 2026-01-04-the-architecture-of-meaning %}) or [Eliot]({% post_url 2026-01-03-the-utility-of-tradition %}).

But it’s also where a question begins to surface.

After reading two of Williams’ most famous poems, I started to wonder whether this simplicity can really hold. Is this meaning durable beyond intimacy, beyond youth, beyond moments saturated by memory and affection? Is Williams doing something fundamentally different from Wordsworth - grounding meaning in perception and experience - or is he returning to the same solution, now stripped of its metaphysical ambition?

Yeats forces a question that Williams seems to sidestep: what happens when the body weakens, when appetite fades, when one is no longer embedded in a warm network of familiarity? If meaning is grounded in immediacy, what happens when immediacy thins?

Williams does not say. And perhaps that is intentional.

It’s worth noting that Williams was a doctor: a highly analytical profession, but also a deeply concrete one. He spent his life dealing with bodies, tools, routines, and ordinary suffering. His poetry seems designed not to answer the largest questions of civilisation or destiny, but to protect something smaller and more fragile: our capacity to attend to what is actually there.

Still, one can’t help but ask whether this is enough. Williams’ meaning is real, but it is local. It is grounded, but it does not obviously scale. It offers no grand vision, no transcendent horizon, no assurance that one’s life participates in something larger than place, memory, and relationship.

Perhaps that is the trade-off. Williams rejects the metaphysical anxiety of the Romantic and modernist tradition—but in doing so, he also refuses its ambition. What remains is beautiful, humane, and honest. It protects our capacity to attend to the world as it is, rather than as we are told it must be.

But this does not make the question disappear. If anything, it sharpens it.

Williams’ poetry leaves me increasingly aware of a tension: between meanings that are immediate and lived, and meanings that aspire to endure beyond circumstance, age, and intimacy. The former feels real and nourishing; the latter feels necessary, even if harder to justify. The more I sit with Williams’ work, the more that tension grows rather than resolves.

For now, I find myself grateful for what Williams offers, even as I feel the question expanding rather than closing. After all, so much does depend upon noticing what is already there - but whether that is enough, over a lifetime, for everyone, remains an open and increasingly pressing question.
