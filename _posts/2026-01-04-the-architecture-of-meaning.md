Today’s entry in the [Poem-a-Day]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/poem-a-day/) challenge is *Sailing to Byzantium* by W. B. Yeats.

Yesterday I read T. S. Eliot and thought about his ideas of tradition—how our humanity is grounded in concepts we inherit. Today, I’m looking at a different response to the problem of grounding.

I should mention that I am taking it upon myself to read these poems directly, without outside analysis, **first**, to develop a sense of what they mean to me before looking more deeply at the context. It seems relevant, then, to recognise that my own perception is already grounded by concepts I’ve learned in the past.

This is the best way to read classics, even if it feels like being thrown in at the deep-end at times. Speak to the author *directly* yourself, first, then only afterwards look at context and analysis.

## A Modernist Looking Back

*Sailing to Byzantium* was written in 1926 and published in 1927. Yeats was roughly 60 years old.

This puts the poem firmly in the Modernist era, published a decade *after* Eliot’s *Prufrock*. However, Yeats occupies a unique position. He began his career in the twilight of the 19th century as a "Late Romantic," obsessed with folklore, nature, and the sublime.

In this poem, he is not writing *from* that Romantic tradition, but looking back at it with the clarity of old age.

The Romantic project of the 19th century was an attempt to ground **Meaning** in **Perception**—most famously in the immediate experience of the natural world. Early Romantics like Wordsworth found that, despite the collapse of the metaphysical beliefs undergirding Western civilization, individual moments of human experience, especially in Nature, were still saturated with Meaning. However, it wasn't long until other Romantics, in exploring this to its natural conclusions, would start to find that Perception itself was ungrounded and sometimes alienating.

At 60 years old, Keats is disillusioned with this approach: as his biology starts to fade, he no longer believes it can bear the weight of **Meaning**. He seeks to build up artificial symbols far and distant from the impermanent reality of his fading body.

## The Kantian Architecture

To deep dive into these ideas, let's look at the philosophical rock star of that earlier era: Immanuel Kant.

Influencing some Romantics, Kant tried to find a grounding for the self and perception in the structure of the mind itself. He proposed the **Transcendental Conditions of Experience**: features necessary for experience to occur (Space, Time, Causality).

> **Note on "Transcendental"**
>
> For Kant, "transcendental" is a logical category, not a mystical one. It refers to what transcends or *grounds* experience, rather than something supernatural.
>
> However, Romantic poets often interpreted this in a mystical direction. The possibility of experiencing the structures of perception—structures not part of ordinary experience—opened the door to a neo-Platonic mysticism that could coexist with modern science.

## Yeats and Distance

Like Eliot's *Prufrock*, *Sailing to Byzantium* deals with themes of youth and old age. But Yeats approaches the lack of grounding differently.

As an older man who has lived through the transition from Romanticism to Modernism, he remains interested in how experience might be grounded. But the poem feels unconvinced that this can be achieved through direct, immediate perception alone. *Prufrock* was not a happy poem, but this poem feels sader, colder, and, to me, more hopeless.

Rather than invoking imagery that is immanent and perceptually close—as Blake does with Jerusalem, or Wordsworth does with Nature—Yeats turns to imagery that is deliberately distant.

He invokes **Byzantium**.

Byzantium is not Jerusalem, nor Rome, and it is not Athens. It is a city that no longer exists under that name. It survives only as an idea, a symbol, a historical memory. It is already abstracted from perception, and in that sense safe from decay.

### The Turn to the Artificial

For Yeats, this distant city becomes the site in which **Meaning** is relocated. It is where the “soul clap its hands and sing,” where permanence is imagined not in flesh but in form.

Yet this meaning is not grounded in lived experience. It is grounded in **Symbols**—crafted, artificial, enduring.

To me, these symbols feel cold, inert, almost lifeless. They are not alive in the way that Wordsworth’s nature is alive. They are hammered, fixed, eternal.

But this is exactly Yeats’ intention. He is not trying to recover meaning *within* existence, but to separate meaning *from* existence. He calls up language and imagery reminiscient of the Romantic project, but with none of the hopefulness that ones feels there.

The attempt to ground meaning in an imagined Byzantium feels uninhabitable. But that uninhabitability is the point. Byzantium is a monument to what meaning looks like once it has been severed from life itself.

> "That is no country for old men."

Yeats appears to be desperately trying to escape the finite reality of lived existence. Old age does not belong in the natural world. Nature is brilliant, even sublime, but it is not transcendent: it is just the cycle of births and deaths.

## Conclusion: The Honest Failure

For me, like *Prufrock*, this poem embeds a problem rather than offering a solution.

It is a search—a desperate search—for a grounding of meaning. But the answer isn't here.

It is said that interesting thinkers do not solve problems so much as take potential solutions all the way through to their necessary conclusions, thereby illuminating the structure of the problem itself. That is what I find here.

I don’t find satisfaction. But in that sense, I embody Yeats’ own experience. Yeats offers an insight into a dying age, one obsessed with both meaning and analysis, seeking desperately to locate a source of meaning—any source—that could withstand the analytical power unleashed by the Enlightenment.

So what can we learn from Yeats?

We learn about the difficulty of trying to ground meaning in direct experience. We learn about the difficult interplay between meaning and our finite existence. We find a bridge from Modernism back to the Romanticism of the previous era.

We learn that neither grounding our meaning only in direct experience (Nature) nor trying to extract it fully into a purely structural distant form (Byzantium) is satisfying.

The poem sets up the stage for Eliot: the only path forward must be some balance between structure and experience—an interplay, or dialectic, of the two.

T.S. Eliot wrote *Prufrock* (1915) and *The Waste Land* (1922) during the same period Yeats was wrestling with these questions. As a younger man, despite his existential axiety, he is more hopeful. His solution was neither pure structure nor pure experience, but the synthesis of the two: **Tradition** *and* the **Individual Talent**.
