Today’s entry in the [Poem-a-Day]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/poem-a-day/) challenge is *Sailing to Byzantium* by W. B. Yeats.

Yesterday I read T. S. Eliot and thought about his ideas of tradition—how our humanity is grounded in concepts we inherit. Today, I’m looking at a different response to the problem of grounding.

I should mention that I am taking it upon myself to read these poems directly, without outside analysis, to develop a sense of what they mean to me before looking more deeply at the context. It seems relevant, then, to recognise that my own perception is already grounded by concepts I’ve learned in the past.

## The Context: Romanticism as a Crisis of Grounding

I’ve never studied Yeats explicitly, but I view him through the lens of British Romanticism.

The broader context of Romanticism is the dawn of the modern age. Religious worldviews were becoming increasingly uninhabitable—particularly in Britain, where science and technology were deeply embedded. For many, religiosity had been the primary ground of meaning; its loss was experienced as a loss of meaning itself.

For earlier Romantics (like Wordsworth), the solution was an inward turn: meaning could be reclaimed from **Perception** itself.

But perception is slippery. For some, rather than providing an unambiguous foundation, perception became unsettling and strange. As Timothy Morton argues, Romanticism is the beginning of the modern condition: an attempt to ground all meaning in perception, only to discover that perception itself must be grounded in something, otherwise it feels uncanny.

### The Kantian Architecture

To understand this, we have to look at Immanuel Kant.

Influencing the later Romantics, Kant tried to find a grounding for perception in the structure of the mind itself. He proposed the **Transcendental Conditions of Experience**: features necessary for experience to occur (Space, Time, Causality).

> **Note on "Transcendental"**
>
> For Kant, "transcendental" is a logical category, not a mystical one. It refers to what transcends or *grounds* experience, rather than something supernatural.
>
> However, Romantic poets often interpreted this in a mystical direction. The possibility of experiencing the structures of perception—structures not part of ordinary experience—opened the door to a neo-Platonic mysticism that could coexist with modern science.

## Yeats and Distance

Like Eliot's *Prufrock*, *Sailing to Byzantium* deals with themes of youth and old age. But Yeats approaches the lack of grounding differently.

As a late Romantic, he remains interested in how experience might be grounded. But he is unconvinced that this can be achieved through direct, immediate perception alone.

Rather than invoking imagery that is immanent and perceptually close—as Blake does with Jerusalem, or Wordsworth does with Nature—Yeats turns to imagery that is deliberately distant.

He invokes **Byzantium**.

Byzantium is not Rome; it is not Athens. It is a city that no longer exists under that name. It survives only as an idea, a symbol, a historical memory. It is already abstracted from perception.

### The Turn to the Artificial

For Yeats, this distant city becomes the site in which meaning is relocated. It is where the “soul clap its hands and sing,” where permanence is imagined not in flesh but in form.

Yet this meaning is not grounded in lived experience. It is grounded in **Symbols**—crafted, artificial, enduring.

To me, these symbols feel cold, inert, almost lifeless. They are not alive in the way that Wordsworth’s nature is alive. They are hammered, fixed, eternal.

But this is exactly Yeats’ intention. He is not trying to recover meaning *within* existence, but to separate meaning *from* existence.

The attempt to ground meaning in an imagined Byzantium feels uninhabitable. But that uninhabitability is the point. Byzantium is a monument to what meaning looks like once it has been severed from life itself.

> "That is no country for old men."

Yeats appears to be desperately trying to escape the finite reality of lived existence. Old age does not belong in the natural world. Nature is brilliant, even sublime, but it is not transcendent: it is just the cycle of births and deaths.

## Conclusion: The Honest Failure

For me, like *Prufrock*, this poem embeds a problem rather than offering a solution.

It is a search—a desperate search—for a grounding of meaning. But the answer isn't here.

It is said that interesting thinkers do not solve problems so much as take potential solutions all the way through to their necessary conclusions, thereby illuminating the structure of the problem itself. That is what I find here.

I don’t find satisfaction. But in that sense, I embody Yeats’ own experience. Yeats offers an insight into an age obsessed with both meaning and analysis, seeking desperately to locate a source of meaning—any source—that could withstand the analytical power unleashed by the Enlightenment.

So what can we learn from Yeats?

We learn about the difficulty of trying to ground meaning in direct experience. We learn about the difficult interplay between meaning and our finite existence.

We learn that neither grounding our meaning only in direct experience (Nature) nor trying to extract it fully into a purely structural distant form (Byzantium) is satisfying.

For me, the only path forward is some balance between structure and experience—an interplay, or dialectic, of the two.

This is exactly where T.S. Eliot finds himself, writing some 100 years after the Romantics first posed the problem. His solution was neither pure structure nor pure experience, but the synthesis of the two: **Tradition** *and* the **Individual Talent**.
