Today’s poem was [The Bear by Galway Kinnell](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42679/the-bear), and it immediately unsettled me.

Unlike some of the other poems I’ve read in this sequence, this one does not circle questions of meaning gently or abstractly. It throws the reader into a primitive, dangerous world—late winter, old snow, hunger, cold. The setting is not symbolic in a refined way. It is immediate. Survival is not optional.

The late winter matters. It carries with it a sense of time and place—the hardest stretch of the year, when resources are scarce and life hangs on endurance. The narrator tracks a bear across _lung-coloured_ snow. The imagery is vivid and tactile. He bends close and puts his nose to the chilly, enduring odour of the bear. There is intimacy here, but not warmth. It is the intimacy of hunger and necessity. A knowing born of survival.

The implements used are natural and brutal: a wolf’s rib sharpened at both ends, coiled in blubber and frozen. It feels like a world untouched by abstraction, by culture, by philosophical distance. This could be an indigenous hunter, or it could be mythic. Either way, it feels primordial. Reality is not questioned; it is endured.

And yet, this world is not liberating. It is imprisoning.

Time is an enemy. Hunger dictates action. The narrator crawls over ice as the bear crawls. Both are forced into prostration by the terrain. On the third day, the narrator is starving. On the seventh, living by blood alone. There are no alternatives. No moral deliberation. No question of whether it is right to pursue and kill. It is life or death.

In earlier poems, nature carried consolation. In Wordsworth, it heals and elevates; in Mary Oliver, it overflows with democratic transcendence. But here, nature is saturated with meaning in a different way. It is not generous. It is not instructive. It does not restore. It imposes.

There is no sense of pastoral freedom. There is only necessity.

When the narrator finally reaches the wounded bear, something shifts. The bear is no longer a thing. It is a “him.” It is dismayed. Its nostrils flare for the first taint of the hunter as it dies. The hunter is not triumphant; he is desperate. The bear is not abstract prey; it is suffering.

Then comes the most disturbing image:

> I hack a ravine into his thigh and eat and drink and tear him down his whole length and open him and climb in and close him up against me, against the wind, and sleep.

The hunter enters the bear.

This is survival, but it is also something else. It is grotesque communion. Identification through ingestion. The boundary between hunter and hunted collapses. The narrator survives by inhabiting the very body he destroyed.

And then the dream.

Inside the bear, he dreams of lumbering over tundra, of being stabbed from within as the bear was stabbed. He imagines the bear’s attempt at “bear transcendence,” its dances of solitude. The suffering is no longer external. It is shared.

This is where the poem does something remarkable. It does not offer transcendence in the way Keats does through beauty, or Yeats through art, or Wordsworth through nature’s healing abundance. It does not elevate the narrator beyond flesh.

But it generates the need for transcendence.

When immanence becomes total—when existence is reduced to blood, digestion, time, decay—the longing for something beyond intensifies. The poem does not resolve that longing. It exposes it.

There is no consolation here. The narrator sickens on bear blood. The body fails. Survival itself becomes grotesque. Nature does not heal; it devours.

And yet, in the identification between hunter and bear—through shared suffering, shared entrapment, shared vulnerability—there is a flicker of something like proto-transcendence. Not escape. Not salvation. But the collapse of isolation.

The hunter is no longer simply the one who kills. The bear is no longer merely prey. They are caught in the same structure of necessity. Both imprisoned by hunger, by winter, by time.

Earlier, I found myself questioning whether meaning grounded in things—Williams’ immanent objects—was too fragile, and whether meaning grounded in nature—whether in Wordsworth’s restorative landscape or Oliver’s generous wilderness—risked becoming sentimental or impersonal. The Bear strips away both comfort and scale. Meaning here is not gentle, and it is not vast. It is forged in extremity.

And this is what unsettled me most: the poem refuses to console, yet it refuses nihilism.

It does not say there is no meaning. It shows that when everything is reduced to survival, something in us still recoils, still imagines, still dreams of transcendence—even if that transcendence remains unrealised.

Nature here is not sanctuary. It is ordeal.

But within that ordeal, the question of transcendence becomes unavoidable.

If Wordsworth suggests that nature elevates us, and Oliver suggests that meaning exceeds us, Kinnell suggests something harsher: when we are forced fully into flesh and necessity, the hunger for transcendence does not disappear. It becomes sharper.

The transcendence we long for here is not the scientist seeing into the source code of the universe; not the sublime transcendence of the Romantic poet wandering in nature; not the love of neighbour and enemy from the Sermon on the Mount. The longing is more primitive. It is a desire to be released from necessity itself—to be freed from a world in which hunger dictates action, in which cold imprisons, and in which one must kill and cannibalise another being simply to continue. This is not hunting in the pastoral sense; it is killing a personified “him” under compulsion. The narrator is enslaved to the conditions.

What this poem generates, then, is not a need for transcendence into nature, but a need for transcendence from it. Whereas many Romantic and later poets seek liberation from human problems by dissolving into the natural world, Kinnell’s poem points in the opposite direction. It exposes just how harsh, how claustrophobic, how unforgiving life in raw nature would be without civilisation—without farming, without stored food, without structures that buffer us from winter and hunger. The poem does not propose a solution, but it lays bare the problem space.

There is meaning here—deep, raw, saturated meaning—but it is not sanctuary. It is not a place one would choose to live. There is no nihilism, perhaps because there is no time for nihilism. Survival occupies every available space. And yet the very intensity of that survival produces a recoil, a sense that something ought to exceed it. The transcendence called for here is not romantic escape; it is liberation from brute necessity.

I finished the poem disturbed.

Not because it denied meaning, but because it refused to soften it.

And in that refusal, it forced the question again—more urgently than before.
