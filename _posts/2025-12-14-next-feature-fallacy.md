## The Next Feature Fallacy

The Next Feature Fallacy describes a common mistake in how organisations reason about customer value.

It is the belief that when there is a gap between a product and customer value, that gap can be closed by expanding the product or shipping another feature. In practice, value gaps arise for multiple, structurally different reasons.

---

## Three Types of Value Gaps

Three are especially common:

(1) **Capability Gap**  
The product genuinely lacks functionality required to generate the value the customer needs.

(2) **Adoption Gap**  
The product has the necessary capability, but the customer is unable or unwilling to use it effectively.

(3) **Alignment Gap**  
The product *is* used as intended and performs well against its internal success metrics, yet still fails to deliver the value the customer believes they are buying.

These gaps operate at different layers: capability, execution, and definition of value. Confusing them leads organisations to apply correct solutions to the wrong problems.

## When Features Are (and Aren’t) the Right Answer

Capability gaps are the most familiar. They map cleanly to roadmaps and delivery plans, which is why feature development becomes the default response. When a true capability gap exists, building a feature is appropriate. When it does not, the same response becomes wasteful.

Adoption gaps sit primarily in the Go-To-Market layer. They are addressed through value framing, simplification of complexity, trust-building, onboarding, and activation. Treating an adoption gap as a capability gap results in solving problems the product does not actually have.

The reverse is also true. A product missing important capabilities will struggle to compete and will fail to deliver the value its prospects are seeking.

## The Alignment Gap

The Alignment Gap is different, and more dangerous.

Here, the product works. Usage is healthy. Internal metrics trend positively. And yet, the customer cannot clearly connect the product’s performance to the value they expected to realise.

This gap emerges when the product’s internal definition of success diverges from the customer’s definition of value.

Every product encodes assumptions about what matters, how progress is measured, and what “good” looks like. These assumptions drive dashboards and optimisation loops. When internal signals improve, the organisation concludes the product is succeeding.

The customer may be evaluating success through a different lens entirely.

Alignment is also bidirectional. Products operate within real technical solution spaces. Customers often arrive with imagined solutions, which are proxies for deeper goals: outcomes, risk reduction, or efficiency. Alignment requires both the product and the customer to converge on what value is realistically achievable.

## Attribution as a Case Study

Attribution in performance marketing makes this dynamic visible.

Attribution systems translate execution-level signals into business narratives. Debates often start with modelling choices - last-click versus multi-touch, rules-based versus algorithmic - but these do not change the outcome the system optimises for.

More complex are debates over metrics: CPC, cost of sale, CPA, lifetime value. In reality, these metrics are not competing truths. They operate at different levels of abstraction and over different time horizons.

Lower-level metrics tend to be stable and controllable. Higher-order metrics express strategic intent but often rely on slower feedback loops, additional assumptions, and interpretation. Alignment problems arise when these layers are collapsed - when execution metrics are expected to explain long-term value, or when strategic outcomes are treated as directly optimisable.

At this point, systems can succeed on their own terms while failing to deliver perceived value.

Adding sophistication does not resolve this. It deepens optimisation around the wrong objective.

## Beyond Attribution

The most effective relationships recognise this explicitly. Alignment runs in both directions: products are clear about what they can optimise, and customers are clear about how higher-order outcomes map onto lower-level signals.

Where this mutual alignment exists, metrics inform decisions. Where it does not, organisations default to the Next Feature Fallacy - seeking better tooling to resolve what is ultimately a conceptual mismatch.

This pattern extends far beyond attribution. Anywhere a system encodes a definition of success and optimises relentlessly against it, alignment gaps can emerge.

Value is not embedded in features or metrics. Value is realised when business goals, value-creation mechanisms, and optimisation metrics are coherently aligned, rather than treating metrics as levers that can substitute for underlying alignment.
