The error began, as errors often do, with a loss of origin.

I now know how rare this is, but when I first started going to the gym, the room was often empty. This made it a calm, almost relaxing experience. After a relatively sedentary life, my muscles really being used. Being in the gym was a great mix of: making progress of my life goals, my body feeling great, and a quiet place for my mind. The closest thing it reminded me of were the days when I used to do yoga every day.

I would walk home from the gym session a few hours later and feel a sense of clarity in my mind and perception. Colours would be brighter, sharper. The night sky would draw me in with the sharp moon and stars twinkling mysteriously.

That feeling had a history. It was nostalgic to me.

### I. The Origin

In my twenties, I took a career break and went travelling to Australia. Early on, I worked on a small holding in the rainforest area of the southwest in New South Wales. It wasn't commercial; the family grew food to feed themselves.

There were three people living on the farm, a couple and their friend, but one stood out. The husband had a quiet sort of confidence and gravitas. When he took me on a tour of the farm, he moved with a calm energy. He was an ex-rugby player, but he was also a yoga instructor.

He looked fundamentally healthy. Not "fitness industry" healthy, which is often a performance of health, but functionally, structurally sound.

I remember thinking: I want that energy. While staying on the farm, I did yoga sessions with him, took it up afterwards and eventually meditation. I did it every day for a year. I carried a yoga mat from hostel to hostel, rolling it out wherever I ended up. This wasn’t just a practice, it was an infrastructure that built on an underlying reorientation: groundedness, clarity, the sense of being at home in my own body.  
  
While this didn’t disappear when I returned to the UK, it was harder to maintain outside of that setting. Attitudes and behaviours are very different. I had stopped doing as much yoga and meditation, but the fundamental orientation was still there just waiting, years later, for the quiet gym to bring it back online.

### II. The Compression Loss

When I first started, I found a routine online: a guide for skinny guys who wanted to bulk up.

It worked. I made progress. But more than the progress, it built that quality in the early days. The work was simple and repetitive in a way that settled the mind. My body was responding, and responding felt good. Not good in a metrics sense, though the metrics were moving too. Good in the way yoga had felt good.

The routine provided a protocol. It translated a fundamental orientation—of self-respect, of being grounded, of caring for your body and yourself—into concrete, repeatable actions.

But the drift happened slowly. A friend of mine started selling personalised training routines. He asked what my goals were.

I said: building muscle.

That was a reasonable answer, but it wasn’t the whole answer. It was just the part of the answer that fit into the box. The rest of it—the meditative quality, the walk home under the moon and stars, the desire to inhabit my body rather than just operate it—didn’t have a form that could survive compression into a text message.

So I sent what was sendable.

The routine he gave me was highly optimised. Lots of exercises, training to failure, targeting everything. I adopted it, and I got stronger. I moved to Camden, kept following the routine, and made progress.

But in doing so, I made a profound architectural error. I thought I was simply updating a protocol—swapping one set of exercises for another at the application layer. In reality, I was accidentally overwriting deeper levels of the infrastructure.

In a previous post, I wrote about the danger of Undocumented Implicit Primitives—the load-bearing assumptions a civilization relies on but never explicitly names. The exact same thing can happen in an individual life.

My original orientation toward self-respect and groundedness was functioning beautifully. But in human terms, it wasn't completely legible. It wasn't explicit to me. I hadn't articulated why the quiet gym felt so restorative; I just knew that it did. Because that meaning hadn't fully sedimented into infrastructure—because I didn't have the language to defend it—it was highly vulnerable.

When I installed my friend's routine, a Silent Overwrite occurred.

Because the true purpose of the practice hadn't been made explicit to myself, the new protocol didn't just optimize the system; it replaced the underlying objective entirely. A practice that originally helped to maintain my relationship with my physical reality was quietly overwritten by a system oriented solely toward maximizing output.

Strength increased. Muscle mass increased. These were easy to measure, easy to compare. But the original meaning receded, not because I deliberately rejected it, but because a legible metric will always crowd out an illegible feeling.

Without the yoga I had done for years, my muscles were getting stiffer. My flexibility was reducing. And I still had a bad shoulder.

### III. Persistent Signal

I had known about the shoulder from the beginning. Certain movements produced a feeling I couldn’t quite name. Not sharp pain, but a wrongness. A structural dissonance.

I had built a story around it: I have a bad shoulder, I need to be careful.

Because the gym protocols were modular, it was always possible to route around the problem. Substitute exercises. Reduce load. Adjust form. The system allowed for local optimisation and work-arounds even while the global architecture remained misaligned.

I could lift heavier weights (unit test passed). I could run 5k (unit test passed). But the system as a whole was fragile.

### IV. The Integration Test

Around this time, I decided to shift to calisthenics. This was part of a broader shift to move away from machines and towards self-reliant and anti-fragile systems. But calisthenics forced me to think from first principles.

Pull-ups are fundamental to calisthenics. I started working toward one.

That was when the shoulder came back.

I scaled back. From negatives to dead hangs. From dead hangs to active hangs. At every level, the same signal. The shoulder wasn’t going away.

A pull-up functions as an integration test. Unlike machine-stabilised exercises, it cannot be decomposed into isolated components. Force must propagate cleanly through the entire structure—fingers, shoulders, torso. If the geometry is wrong, the force has nowhere to go.

And my geometry was wrong.

The underlying issue, once I finally understood what I was looking at, was entirely mundane: mild kyphosis and lordosis. These are the classic structural adaptations of a body that spends too much time in chairs—the upper back rounds forward, the shoulders slump inward, and the lower back over-arches to compensate. It is the physical manifestation of a sedentary lifestyle.

The traditional gym exercises I had been doing for five years had completely failed to prevent or rehabilitate this structural drift. I had been building muscle, but I was building it on top of a compromised frame. In systems terms, I had been scaling the application layer while the hardware itself was warping to the shape of an office desk. By loading heavy weights onto a misaligned spine, the routine hadn't fixed the foundational problem; it had merely entrenched it.

The shoulder pain wasn't a mysterious glitch. It was a mechanical bottleneck. When I hung from the bar, the force couldn't propagate cleanly because the architecture was crooked.

Local strength is not sufficient. Alignment is required.

It felt, at first, like five years of effort had been wasted. Like I had been revving in neutral. All that progress, and I still couldn’t do a single integrated movement.

But that feeling shifted as my physical awareness grew. The shoulder wasn’t a flaw I had failed to fix. It was a signal I hadn't been able to receive—because I hadn't put enough integrated load through the system to make the signal visible.

You can’t find a foundation problem from the outside. You have to build on it first.

### V. Refactoring

In software, when you realize your architecture can't support the scale and complexity you need, you stop shipping features and you start refactoring. You clean up the code. You resolve the dependencies.

The body operates under similar constraints. Strength scales force production. Alignment determines whether that force can be transmitted safely.

I am currently refactoring.

The fix isn’t more training. It’s closer to physiotherapy—working at a layer below the exercises I thought I was doing. Wall raises. Scapular movement. Working my way up to active hangs.

I’ve brought the load right down. Refactoring produces fewer visible signals than optimisation. Weight decreases. Progress appears to reverse. Externally, it resembles regression. Internally, it restores coherence.

### VI. Synthesis

When I started thinking from first principles about what I actually wanted from exercise—really wanted, not what was sendable in a message—I found myself back somewhere familiar.

The quiet gym in Bristol. The walk home under the stars. The man on the farm.

The orientation I started with was the right one for me. I just didn’t have the language for it, or the infrastructure to hold it in place when something more systematic came along. That isn’t to say that focusing on bodybuilding might not be right for someone else, so long as it’s healthy.

Building muscle is a legible goal. The other thing—groundedness, clarity, self-respect—is harder to measure. So it is easier to displace.

The shoulder brought me back. Not by teaching me something new, but by refusing to let me keep building on a foundation I hadn't properly laid.

I’m still in the middle of this. The rehab is ongoing. But the orientation feels clearer than it has in years. It’s no longer about sending what is sendable. It’s about building a system that can hold the weight of the life I actually want to live.
